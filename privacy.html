    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 30, 2025</p>

    <p>Tend SMS (“Tend,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how
        we use it, and your choices when you use our SMS-based service.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We collect only the minimum information necessary to operate the service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your phone number.</li>
        <li>Your first name and, optionally, the first names of your contacts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect last names, email addresses, payment details, or other personal identifiers. We may also
        process limited technical and usage data (such as message delivery confirmations and error logs) to operate and
        improve the service.</p>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use your information solely to provide and maintain the SMS messaging service, including to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Send and deliver SMS messages</li>
        <li>Manage opt-in, opt-out, and consent status</li>
        <li>Monitor performance and prevent abuse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your information for targeted advertising or unrelated marketing.</p>

    <h3>Sharing of Your Information</h3>
    <p><strong>We do not sell or share mobile numbers, consent status, or SMS opt-in data with third parties or
            affiliates for marketing.</strong> Mobile information is used only to deliver the messaging program and may
        be shared with service providers solely to provide that service (for example, SMS delivery partners).</p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>We implement reasonable safeguards to protect the limited personal information we collect. However, no method of
        transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>Your Choices and Rights</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt out at any time by responding “STOP” or "UNSUBSCRIBE" to any SMS.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> You may delete your data at any time by responding "DELETE" to any SMS, or by contacting us
            at <a href="mailto:hello@tendsms.com">hello@tendsms.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children. If
        we become aware of such collection, we will delete it.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” above and
        post the new version on this page.</p>

    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us: <a
